# TODO List

## I genuinely do not need all these functionalities on the discord bot but I'll update this document for all things that needs to be done

* [ ] Randomiser that changes the expression of characters 'f#' where # is the desired random facial expressions
* [X] Kittify characters by identifying the gender and the associated hair color for a kittified-character
* [ ] Identify useful cogs and archive the ones not important
* [ ] Consolidate important functions from similar bots
* [ ] Consider modular implementations of the $maple command to allow for variations such as kittify, mounts, nekkid-character (,,>﹏<,,) and more!
* [ ] "Three-way handshake" discord role auto-assign(User input IGN, discord bot verifies from ML site, discord group admin/member approve/deny)
* [ ] Create the logic for generating !maple. Hopefully be able to handle gifs and images instead of dealing with static charinfo.
* [ ] Figure how to display charinfo for above point
* [ ] Make the prefix configurable
* [ ] Mayhaps suggest more stuffs

## Done

* [X] Nothing at all ;w;
